<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- Need a good pic here!
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
In this examination of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (aka PGH) we will take you on a tour using maps and data that will
give you a deeper understanding of what's really going on here. We'll present visual boundaries: City Council Districts / voting wards /
neighborhoods and more, combined with various datasets from entities such as the US Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the USDA, and NASA, to name a few. After this journey you will understand what factors make Pittsburgh one of the worst cities in America for 'racial' and income inequity.

Pittsburgh is one of the worst cities for racial and economic inequity?:
* Allegheny County says... `'PGH... not a good place for people of color'`.
* The reinvestment Fund ranked Pittsburgh **3rd worst in the country**.
* Listen to my podcast about living with Martins and Bernies and more.
